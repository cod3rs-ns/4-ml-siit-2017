# Third assignment - Naive Bayes Classifier

## Technologies and libs
- Python 2.7.x
- pandas

## Solution description
  We use **Naive Bayes Classifier** algorithm to predict output **contraceptive** for input data
  that contains 8 features.
  
## Results
  When we applied our algorithm to test set which contains 7 examples, we predict **5** out of 
  **7** correct values. Our **accuracy** is 71%.
