Solution description:
  We use simple linear regression (y_hat = intercept + slope * x) where 'y_hat' is predicted output, 'x' is input,
  and 'intercept' and 'slope' are learned values.

  Main work is done in preprocessing mode. We noticed on graph our data is exponential. But, we do little trick -
  on every output value we applied 'log' function. Also, before learning coefficients, we normalized our data with
  '(y - mean)/std'.

  We removed outliers manually (3 of them). After evaluating our algorithm using RMSE method our error is 1.86171.
