Solution description:
  We use simple linear regression (y_hat = intercept + slope * x) where 'y_hat' is predicted output, 'x' is input,
  and 'intercept' and 'slope' are learned values.

  Main work is done in preprocessing mode. We noticed on graph our data is exponential. But, we do little trick -
  on every output value we applied 'log' function. Also, before learning coefficients, we normalized our data with
  '(y - mean)/std'.

  We removed outliers manually (3 of them). After evaluating our algorithm using RMSE method our error is 1.86171.


Alternative methods:
  We also try to fit model with RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm, because we wanted to use algorithm that
  is resistant to outliers. The main problem in using this algorithm was range of achieved RMSE ... from 1.1 to 9.0.

  Why this happens?

  First of all, result of algorithm depends on initial random chosen points. Also, our data distribution (a lot grouped data
  in vertical lines) made that the consensus set is always same, but with different slope and intercept which change
  our model a lot.
